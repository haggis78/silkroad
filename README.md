# Silk Road
This code, and the page it creates, was originally written by a class of undergraduate students at Pitt-Greensburg in 2021. In December 2024, it was relaunched here with some cleanup by Dr. William Campbell. The home page of the re-launched site is https://haggis78.github.io/silkroad/ .

The earlier website is at https://haggis78.github.io/testing123/ , and its repo is at https://github.com/haggis78/testing123 .
