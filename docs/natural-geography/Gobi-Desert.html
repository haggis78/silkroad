        <h1>Gobi Desert</h1>
        <p>Named by the Mongolians who were, for so long, limited in their westward expansions by the unforgiving expanses of the Gobi, the desert certainly lives up to its name. The Gobi Desert is one of twenty-three of the worlds’ deserts and is known to be the sixth largest desert in size. The Gobi Desert stretches to roughly 1.3 million square kilometers, it is large enough to fit the land mass of the UK and Spain within its borders. This desert is not only large but is also one of the hottest and coldest deserts in the world. </p>
        <p>In the Gobi Desert, temperatures reach a scorching temperature of 55° C (131° F) in the summer season and a frigid temperature of −40 °C (−40 °F). The reason behind this desert’s drastic changes in temperature is due to the high altitude that it resides in. The Gobi is a rain shadow desert, formed by the Tibetan Plateau and Himalayan mountains blocking precipitation from the Indian Ocean from reaching the Gobi territory. An average of approximately 194 mm (7.6 in) of rain falls annually in the Gobi, but the western region may not see rain all year. Additional moisture reaches parts of the Gobi in winter as snow is blown by the wind from the Siberian Steppes. </p>

        <p>Due to the Gobi Desert’s harsh terrain and varying conditions year-round, explorers, travelers, and merchants during the silk road era did their best to avoid traveling through it if possible. Not only does the Gobi Desert have treacherous weather conditions, but it is also home to many valleys of sand dunes and bandits. The Silk Road played a large role in the economies of regions, and this was no different for the lands within the Gobi Desert. The Gobi Desert is home to nine naturally formed oases which became important rest stops for travelers during the years of the silk road.<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Sometimes an unavoidable part of the Silk Road, the Gobi featured many market towns, rest stops, and routes through its least hospitable stretches. <a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
        <p>During the height of the Mongol Empire, the Mongols had complete control of the Gobi Desert, and therefore held vital trade routes to southern Mongolia and northeastern China. These trade routes were an important source of income for the empire. The Mongols took advantage of the lands they controlled and taxed travelers who were bold enough to traverse the Gobi. Even though the Mongol Empire held control of the Gobi Desert, few Mongols actually resided in the Gobi Desert because they preferred the grasslands called Steppes. In the modern era, China and Mongolia hold split control of the Gobi Desert and it is home to not only famous discoveries of dinosaur species, but also holds rich natural resources within its borders. The desert is rich in copper, gold, crude oil, and coal deposits.<a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>
